# Flowshop_Iterative_Heuristics
Code that accompanies the research paper Pareto Optimum-based Heuristic Algorithms for Minimizing Tardiness and Late Jobs in a Single Machine Flowshop Problem. It includes code to generate test cases, the test cases used, functions for running the algorithms, and code to generate graphs for comparison.

1_MILP_exact_single_and_multi_machine_algorithms: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solutions for the single and multi-machine non-parallel flowshop variations. It has a more specific READ_ME file for more information.

2_Single_Machine_NN_and_Heuristic: Training & testing of neural network as described in the paper, and heuristic comparison files for insertion and selection heuristics.
