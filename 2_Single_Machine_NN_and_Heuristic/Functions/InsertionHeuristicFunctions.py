This file includes two different implementations of the insertion heuristic to
estimate an optimum schedule for a single machine.  The file also includes the necessary accessory functions
    
There are two implementations of the insertion function heuristic:

1.    'insertHeurFn' 

To use this function, include in your code:
    
    from InsertionHeuristicFunctions import insertHeurFn

A function call to insertHeurFn has the following form:
    
    
    perms, penalties, finish =  insertHeurFn(A, D, X, P, Q)

Inputs to select:
    
    A: Arrival times (1-d array)
    D: Due times (1-d array, same size as A)
    X: Execution times (1-d array, same size as A and D)
    P,Q:  Weight coefficients for nonzero tardiness indicator and tardiness, respectively 
          (can be scalars or arrays)
          
Outputs are:

    perms: List of permutations that have minimum penalty that also have minimum finish time.
    penalties:  penalties of permutations in 'perms' list
    finish: finish times of permutations in 'perms' list

2.    'insertHeurFnLimIns' 

This function is like 'insertHeurFn', but limist the insertion of new jobs to the last 'insert' positions in the list.

To use this function, include in your code:
    
    from InsertionHeuristicFunctions import insertHeurFnLimIns

A function call to insertHeurFn has the following form:
    
    
    perms, penalties, finish =  insertHeurFn(A, D, X, P, Q,insert)

Inputs:
    
    A: Arrival times (1-d array)
    D: Due times (1-d array, same size as A)
    X: Execution times (1-d array, same size as A and D)
    P,Q:  Weight coefficients for nonzero tardiness indicator and tardiness, respectively 
          (can be scalars or arrays)
    insert:  New jobs can only be inserted in the last 'insert' positions in the previous job list.
          
Outputs:

    perms: List of permutations that have minimum penalty that also have minimum finish time.
    penalties:  penalties of permutations in 'perms' list
    finish: finish times of permutations in 'perms' list
