# Flowshop_Iterative_Heuristics
Code that accompanies the research paper Two Pareto Optimum-based Heuristic Algorithms for Minimizing Tardiness and Late Jobs in the Single Machine Flowshop Problem. It includes code to generate test cases, the test cases used, functions for running the algorithms, and code to generate graphs for comparison.

1_MILP_exact_single_and_multi_machine_algorithms: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solutions for the single and multi-machine non-parallel flowshop variations. It has a more specific READ_ME file for more information.

2_Single_Machine_NN_and_Heuristic: Training & testing of neural network as described in the paper, and heuristic comparison files for insertion and selection heuristics.

3_Neural_Network: Neural network training data and models.
